## Notes
You can add whatever library you want to. Do not reinvent the wheel.
## Api server
Whichever your test is you will need to conect to an api, this api is provided by the project inside `./server`, you can run it with  ```npm run serve```. For more info please see the project readme (`./serve/README.md`).
### Start
Once you have the server up and running you can start with the test you have been assigned. We have provided a simple start app with a watcher and outo reload for all 3 tests (Angular, React and HTML CSS JS), however you are free to start from scratch if you want to do so. If you choose to use one of the provided apps you will find more details on each README.md file.
